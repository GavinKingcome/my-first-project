  The side preview for README files.
  Part 1: Compare the markdown code to the preview:

What do you think the # character does to the text next to it? What is the difference between using one # or two together?
What do you think the output would be if you changed ## Credits to ### Credits? Try it to check.
What other features do you see in the documentation that have been written in Markdown? What can you learn about the syntax of a link in Markdown from the code provided?
Add a new feature to the features list: "Footer". How quickly does the preview update? Did you need to save before seeing your changes?
Part 2: Add your changes to GitHub

Complete the git commit cycle to commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. What do you see when you refresh the repository page?
Why do you think it might be important to write documentation about your projects?
